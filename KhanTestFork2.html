	["Passage 1", //Passage Title
	'<p>In 1960, Dr. George Sperling asked participants to recall a 4x3 group of letters flashed on a screen for less than a second. When instructed to recall as many letters as possible, most participants could only name the first four or five letters.</p><p>Dr. Sperling then asked another group to name only one of the rows. After they saw the image flash, he would randomly sound one of three tones. Sounding a high-frequency tone indicated that the participant should give the first line of letters; a medium-frequency tone indicated the middle row; and a low-frequency tone asked for the last row. If the tone was broadcast immediately after the image was flashed, the majority of subjects recalled all four letters. This marked the discovery of iconic memory, the visual form of sensory memory. Audible sensory memory (also known as echoic memory) lasts for several seconds.</p><div id="figure"><img src="https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/a7d4238a28e6eef5321d3f6278fb17ce5a9461cf.png"></div><b>Figure 1</b><span id="figure">Experimental setup for Dr. Sperling</span><p>Sensory memory is constantly processing enormous amounts of information from the world around you. What you pay attention to gets passed into working memory. This stage can be described in three major sections – the visuospatial sketchpad, the phonological loop, and the central executive. The sketchpad stores visual information, like a photograph, while the loop deals with words and numbers. The job of coordinating the two falls to the central executive – connecting an address you hear with a map that you see, for example.</p>', //Passage with Formatting

	'<p>Our ability to perceive the world around us is based on the fact that we are constantly making inferences about the various stimuli that we are exposed to. These inferences allow us to notice meaningful patterns and pay attention to novel stimuli in order to enhance our mental representations of the world. <i>Gestalt psychology</i> is one school of thought that seeks to understand perceptual organization, and operates from the viewpoint that human beings perceive phenomenon as whole, grouped parts, rather than perceiving individual features. <i>Gestalt theory,</i> when applied to perceptions of physical facial attractiveness, would suggest that ratings of the attractiveness of a person’s face would be based on an evaluation of the grouped, collective features of the whole face, rather than on distinct evaluations of specific parts of their face (like their nose shape, eye color, or lips). From this perspective a person with symmetrical facial traits might be evaluated as more attractive than someone with asymmetrical traits, because their face, when evaluated as a whole, appears to be more proportional and similar.</p><p>A researcher is interested in finding out how perceptions of facial symmetry influence ratings of attractiveness. She alters a photo of a man and woman to create two images - one depicts their faces as having high symmetrical features, while the other depicts their faces as having low symmetrical features. She shows the pictures to 400 undergraduates and asks them to rate the attractiveness of the individuals in the photos on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 indicating that the faces are not attractive and 10 indicating that faces are highly attractive. Table 1 outlines the mean attractiveness ratings for the images.</p><b>Table 1</b><span id="figure">Experimental setup for Dr. Sperling</span><div id="table"><img src="img/gestaltTable.png"></div>',
