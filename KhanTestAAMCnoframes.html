Sensory memory is constantly processing enormous amounts of information from the world around you. What you pay attention to gets passed into working memory. This stage can be described in three major sections – the visuospatial sketchpad, the phonological loop, and the central executive. The sketchpad stores visual information, like a photograph, while the loop deals with words and numbers. The job of coordinating the two falls to the central executive – connecting an address you hear with a map that you see, for example. <br>"
